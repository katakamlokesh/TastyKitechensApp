In this Proto-type mini-project , I was  built a  ***Tasty Kitchens App***  by applying the concepts that I have learned till now.
    
In this, I was Implemented a  ***Responsive food delivery application***  with basic features and their functionality like,
- user login,home contains offers and resturants list with sort by functionality lowest/highest,
- specific restaurants details and the food available in the restaurant and adding food items then add subtract and
- finally cart features like cart-items-list and total bill decrementing/incrementing cart items in cart route and payment section etc


## Implementatioin steps
- to achive these files more effective i have utilizied `figma`  mockups
- implemented different routes for login,home,specific restuarant details,cart by using  `React Router components Route,Switch,Link,Redirect` etc.
- used username and password for authentication login/logout,
- stored access token in `Cookies` for authorization on different routes
- used a react-third-library `React-Slick` for implementing offers carousels in home route
- used `fetch` to call `REST API`s for restaurants with sortby,specific restaurant details,
- I have implemented `Pagination` to get a specific number of items from the list of items in a certain range 
- Implemented Sortby functionality by which user can filter list by rating lowest/highest
- Implemented Adding items to `Local Storage` by using the key name `cartData`
